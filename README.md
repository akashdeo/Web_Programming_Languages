Assignment number 1:

Create your personal homepage
Create your personal homepage  (file should be named index.html) and upload it to utdallas.edu. 
The web page should contain legitimate information about you (background information, hobbies, interests etc.) and should not contain any HTML code that is generated by a web design tool (FrontPage, PageMaker, and etc.)
1. In your page’s HTML, make sure to include following elements:
	<img> : On your home page put your profile picture and float it to the left. (in the middle part where you see Welcome heading)
	<meta> for description of your web page
	<meta> for the keywords associated with your page
	favorites icon ("favicon")

2. Your page layout should have the same layout given in below picture.  In the header section, you will have menu items Home, About, Projects and Contact. (You can omit Logo and Login)
3. For style of your page, use an external css file (filename: index.css) and define your style sheet rules within that file.
4. Links on the top menu should take the user to the corresponding section within the same page. Links on the left can be to external websites.
5. You can have any content on the right panel.

Assignment number 2:

Form validation is a way for you to tell the user what kind of input is required in each field, and allows you to notify the user when the input is incorrect. There are many ways to do form validation, but in this assignment, by using JQuery, you will write a plugin that displays information/error messages besides the fields. 

Requirements

The code files for form validation are validate.html, validate.css and validate.js. You will only modify validate.js.

The validations are as follows:
•	The username field must contain only alphabetical or numeric characters.
•	The password field should be at least 8 characters long.
•	The email field should be a valid email address (local-part@domain)
When the validation function is invoked, you should insert a <span> notification element immediately after the form field. The notification element should initially be hidden.
When the field is currently being edited, the notification element’s text should be infoMessage, its class should be “info”, and it should be visible.
When the field is not being edited:
•	If the field is empty, the notification element should be hidden.
•	If the field is non-empty and the form field validates, the notification element’s text should be “OK”, its class should be “ok”, and it should be visible.
•	If the field is non-empty and the form field does not validate, the notification element’s text should be “Error”, its class should be “error”, and it should be visible.
Hints
You should use the form events functions to detect when a form field gains or loses focus. You should not use mouse and keyboard events such as click or keydown: there are multiple ways to give a form field focus, and it is difficult to detect all of them reliably using mouse and keyboard events.
Span elements can be added using element creation and DOM insertion.


Assignment number 3:

Every 10 years, the Social Security Administration provides data about the 1000 most popular boy and girl names for children born in the US for each gender at http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/. 
Your task for this assignment is to display the baby names and their popularity rankings for a given year and gender. You will implement the project using AJAX technology, PHP and DBMS.
On your html page (babynames.html), you will have one division element (for results), two drop-down lists (for year and gender) and one button. Once clicked on the button, you will call Ajax function which will ultimately make a request for babynames.php on the server.
In babynames.php, you will connect to the database and fetch the top-five popular names for the given gender and the given year.  (If year is not selected it will show the names for all years. Similarly, if the gender is not selected it will display the names for both boys and girls.)
The results will be passed to the client and will be used to dynamically change the contents of the division on the html page. Along with each baby name, you will also list the popularity ranking, gender and the year.
For database part, you will create a table with following schema:
BabyNames(name, year, ranking, gender) 
For gender values, use ‘m’ and ‘f’.
You can use data given on the following page to populate your table:
http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/top5names.html
It is sufficient if you include data for the years between 2005 and 2015 (including both) or you can use attached sql file to insert tuples.
